# 20-Projects-Profile

## Description

This is a REACT portfolio web app. It showcases some snippets of my projects to date, provides a brief bio/introduction, and makes available various contact methods.  As of the date I am submitting this for grading, 11/07/2023, I can say that I am proud of where I have molded this app to presently, but the perfectionist in me sees the those little details I just could not figure out.  All this to say nothing of the near endless time that could easily be spent perfecting and perfecting and perfecting and pefecting... The desire to Grok is strong üññüèª!
